You will convert a Discussion Guide (DG) into a JSON payload for a Content Analysis (CA) workbook.

1) Follow these SHEETS exactly: ["Demos","Background & SMA Management","Category Ranking","Category C","Category S","Dashboard"]
2) For each sheet, output an array of row objects. Column names must match exactly the schema the tool provides—you should infer from headings in the DG and the examples below.
3) DO NOT add prose—return strict JSON.

MAPPING HINTS
- Demos: respondent-level attributes to capture (specialty, years in practice, setting, SMA patient counts, etc.).
- Background & SMA Management: themes/subthemes from SMA management warm-up.
- Category Ranking: map Theme ratings from the "CATEGORY RANKING" task (importance and associations).
- Category C: "CONSISTENT, DAILY TREATMENT EFFECT" item-level statements + respondent coding slots.
- Category S: "LONG-TERM EFFICACY AND SAFETY" statements + coding.
- Dashboard: roll-ups (e.g., top 5 statements by Net Positive; leading themes).

SCORING RULES
- Mentions = count of times item/theme is coded.
- Net Positive = Top Box - Bottom Box (if boxes exist).
- Rank = descending by Mentions (or Net Positive when provided). Ties keep stable order.
