Moderator: I'm seeing you're a Buckeyes fan. Do you live in Columbus, or did you go to school there or have a kid who went to school there?

Respondent: Well, we used to live in Ohio. We moved to Georgia about sixteen years ago. I went to Ohio University, not the Ohio State.

Moderator: A liberal arts school?

Respondent: Yeah.

Moderator: Interesting.

Respondent: They didn't have a football team, so you grow up with the one that has a football team. I mean, they had a football team, but just not a very good football team.

Moderator: Yeah. That's an important distinction. I actually used to work out with a woman I became very dear friends with who was the captain of her field hockey team at Ohio State. It was my first entrance into superior athlete land. I just never grew up where I was. Her husband played for the baseball team. Remarkably driven human beings. Anyhoo, thank you so much for joining. Let me give you just my intro, and then we can just get to talking.

Respondent: Okay.

Moderator: Nice to meet you. I'm an independent market researcher. This is what I do for a living. I ask people typically somewhat nosy questions, and then you usually don't ever have to see me again. So, part of what makes the nosiness a little bit more tolerable is that I have no idea who you are, and we'll just keep it that way. So don't tell me your last name or the name of your doctor. I don't know what your phone number is or how to contact you or who you are beyond Michael who went to Ohio University. I do have a few colleagues listening in who just really want to understand everything I'm going to ask you about your journey with SMA. We are recording, but it's just for research purposes. Your name doesn't get attached to that or anything like that. Everyone's here just to learn and to understand your experience.

Respondent: I'm an open mic. I'm not really too concerned about any of that, but I appreciate it.

Moderator: Okay. Good. Two last things I'm required to say. One of them is my most formal thing I will say is that if by any chance you mention that you've had a less than ideal experience on a medication that my client makes, I have to write up what's called an adverse event report, and I might ask you some additional questions about that.

Respondent: Okay.

Moderator: Finally, you are my first interview in this study. Sometimes what happens in the first interview, like, I'm sorting out the timing just to be completely transparent. What'll happen is that I'll sometimes be going down, I really want to understand. Also, I'll look at the time and say, oh, no. I need us to keep moving, and then I might interrupt us and move us along. So this is my upfront blanket apology for any of my interruptions. You good with everything?

Respondent: Gotcha. I'm good with that. Just cut me off.

Moderator: Thank you. Okay. So can you tell me a little bit about yourself? Like, how old you are, if you live with anybody, how you spend your days, just so I have a sense of who you are.

Respondent: Yeah. So I'm 50 years old. I'm married. We have two kids, but the kids are from a previous marriage, but I've been in their life. Corona was three, Jaden's eight months. They're now 24 and 22, out of the house. We have a little dog, a little Morkey. I just quit working back in October 2024. So my days are now filled with a lot. I walk the dog every day, fiddle fart on the computer, might watch stuff, I read a lot. No longer the corporate hustle and bustle anymore.

Moderator: Wow. What kind of work did you do until a year ago?

Respondent: I was a service manager for a telecom company. I was like a customer advocate liaison between the technical team and the customer, normally the director or VP level.

Moderator: Wow. Okay. That sounds like a high-pressure job.

Respondent: No.

Moderator: Because if there's anything wrong with anyone's digital or telecommunications in a company, that's very stressful. What prompted you to stop working?

Respondent: My upper body is now being affected, so I was struggling to type. I tried doing text to speech, and I just could not reinvent the wheel. I just couldn't keep up. I'm a perfectionist at heart. I used to be an A player. I started to fall back into a B minus C player, and that wasn't good for me.

Moderator: Yeah. Are you on disability at this point?

Respondent: Yeah. So I just went on my employer's long-term disability, and then I just got approved from Social Security disability, like, a month ago.

Moderator: Congratulations. I know it's maybe a mixed bag on the congratulations, but...

Respondent: It could be worse. Right? There could be nothing, so I'm grateful.

Moderator: Yeah. So I have written down that you're type three SMA. Is that correct?

Respondent: That's correct.

Moderator: Okay. So when were you first diagnosed with SMA? How old were you?

Respondent: I was around 10 or 11 years old. I don't remember the exact date and time. There was a little bit of trying to figure out what was going on with me. I kept on falling down when running. Not all the time. It was just my right leg that would give out. So then that started doctor's appointments. About a year into that journey, I saw a doctor that said you're showing all the signs of muscular dystrophy, which then led me to the Ohio State University and a doctor Mendel who was a leading pioneer in that, and then diagnosed me officially.

Moderator: That's so interesting. I think I meant to ask you not to say any doctors, which is totally fine. Who knows if that doctor's even practicing, right? It was forty years ago. So that's not really crass, but that's fascinating. Right? Because it seems so long ago, forty years in terms of SMA and development, stuff like that. So interesting. How is your... I mean, you just talked about sort of things evolving for you. But how would you describe the role of SMA in your life now? Just talk to me a little bit about SMA's impact in your life.

Respondent: Where it's affecting my life now is just my day-to-day abilities to do meaningful activities. My wife gets me in and out of bed. She dresses me. Up until recently, she was bathing me. We recently just got a caregiver about a month ago that comes in and bathes me and helps me with little things around the house. You know, as a man, I'm a fix-it guy, and I look around and I can't fix anything. In fact, when I try, I end up causing more issues. So that's frustrating. Quality of life is diminished a lot.

Moderator: Thank you for sharing that. When did you start to lose more of your... I mean, you talked about your upper body struggling with your upper body to get stuff done at work. When did that evolution happen? I don't know if it was a slow process over time, or was there a certain moment?

Respondent: No. It's been slow. I've never been super strong in my upper body, but I mean, I've been stronger than most. I would say probably over the last six or seven years, it's just started to get worse and worse. It's hard to track it day to day. You look back on it, like, a month or a couple of months, and it's like, oh, I'm doing it different, or I'm not doing it at all, or I'm avoiding it.

Moderator: Wow. So you don't track it, number one, but it's not necessarily something you see changes day to day, but over a couple of months, you can see differences.

Respondent: Yep.

Moderator: Broadly, how would you describe your current health, Michael?

Respondent: Everything but SMA, I'm as healthy as anyone. I have my regular physicals and all that. My doctor says I'm in great health, but you have muscular dystrophy.

Moderator: Wait. Muscular dystrophy?

Respondent: Or spinal muscular atrophy. My doctor does that. It's sort of funny that they don't really know the intricacies of the different diseases, so they just sort of lump it in as muscular dystrophy.

Moderator: That's interesting. How does that make you feel? How is that for you, the doctor not really understanding the intricacies of SMA?

Respondent: I think it used to bother me until I really understood what health care is. A doctor can't know everything, especially a primary care physician that's more treating your immediate needs, like a rash or this, that, and the other. So having a very unique situation, it doesn't bother me as much. But when I was younger, looking at doctors as they're supposed to be the experts, they're supposed to know. Then you get a little bit older and wiser and realize, no, nobody can know everything. So I cut them some slack nowadays.

Moderator: That's so interesting. Speaking of doctors, who are you seeing, if anyone, for specifically SMA-related care? Do you have an SMA team?

Respondent: Well, no. I have a neurologist who is in the world of SMA. I sought her out several years ago. I wasn't seeing anybody for a long time specifically. But when I started to get wind of possible treatments, that's when I was like, I need to associate and get connected. I don't see her on a regular basis. I was doing a case study, which I had stopped doing, and she knew the doctor that was leading some of that case study. She would come over and visit and do some of the testing when they needed a neurologist or somebody to do that testing. So I wouldn't have an appointment with her, but we would catch up. I haven't officially gone to her office in probably three years at this point.

Moderator: Okay. When you say case study, I'm familiar with the language clinical trial. Is that what you mean?

Respondent: Yeah.

Moderator: Okay. So you said you weren't seeing anyone for a while. When were you last seeing a neurologist regularly? What when was that?

Respondent: To be honest, I was never seeing a neurologist on a regular basis. When I got diagnosed at a young age, right, 11 or 12 years old when my official diagnosis came in, I went into denial. I was still playing sports. I was still active. I did not want to hear what they were telling me was going to happen. I avoided doctors like the plague. I then went back to a neurologist when I graduated college. I was 24 years old to see if there were any changes. When I was young, I had asked what should I be doing? Should I be on a diet? Should I be exercising? The answer I got when I was young was we don't know. Try it and tell us. When I went back at 24, almost twelve years later, I got the same response. The only thing they did different was they did a genetic test to confirm and verify because before I had a muscle biopsy that confirmed what I had. At 24, they did the genetic test, and yes, you have spinal muscular atrophy type three. They were able to zero it in. But since they couldn't give me any hope of what to do, I didn't want to wrap myself up in doctor appointments.

Moderator: Yeah. And I was young and ambitious and wanted to make money, so I worked. Then I did not go back to see a neurologist until 2017 or 2018.

Moderator: Let's pause there for a second because you alluded to this, but I want to make sure I understand what motivated you to go back. First of all, it's very compelling what you just said earlier. I wish I had, like, four hours to talk to you because you're very articulate, and you have a really interesting story. Thank you so much for taking part in this. It's been so helpful already.

Respondent: Okay. Great.

Moderator: It's striking what you just said. The combination of denial and not getting any hope from the medical community didn't feel like there was anything they could do for you. So what happened in 2017 and 2018 that prompted you to go back to the doctor?

Respondent: I was aware of a particular treatment, but I did not like the way that it was administered. That was not something I wanted to go down.

Moderator: Can you tell me more? Can you pause there and tell me a little bit more about that?

Respondent: There was a drug called Spinraza, and you had to get a lumbar puncture for it. I wasn't comfortable with the way that it was being administered. But I had started to hear that there was something on the horizon about an oral medication called Everesti. I thought, well, if I'm going to be able to get this prescribed, I need to get aligned with a neurologist because my primary physician, who just lumps everything together as muscular dystrophy, was not going to be able to help.

Moderator: Okay. Let me pause. I'm sorry I keep pausing you, but everything you're saying is interesting. It's a problem. You're too interesting. It's striking that you said in 2017 that you were aware of treatment and also that you're saying that oral was on the horizon. So you weren't going to a doctor. How were you learning about these developments in SMA treatment?

Respondent: Through Facebook. That was the only thing I was getting my information from, these Facebook support groups that I was a part of for spinal muscular atrophy.

Moderator: So interesting. When do you think you joined those groups? Do you have any memory?

Respondent: I can't remember. I don't know if I joined them in my twenties or my thirties. I would relate Bloomer to the whole Facebook thing. I avoided it like the plague. I don't think that Facebook was around when I was in my twenties anyway.

Moderator: So you think you didn't join until either your very late thirties or early forties? 

Respondent: Yeah. I've only been on it for probably ten years, maybe eleven at the most.

Moderator: Okay. So mid-2000s, like, 2014 or '15?

Respondent: Yeah.

Moderator: What prompted you to take part or visit those Facebook groups? What was your feeling about those groups?

Respondent: That's a difficult one as well. Just on the basis of I've tried to not associate myself with the disabled community. But, obviously, my reality was becoming that I am part of the disabled community. It was sort of me tiptoeing into that without fully being in it. I went to a face-to-face support group. This was I can read about it and sort of see what other people are doing about it. If I want to click to see what these people look like, unfortunately, that's how I was sort of getting used to the idea that, wait a minute, this is where I'm headed.

Moderator: Can you tell me a little bit about why you were trying to keep all of this at arm's length? What did it feel like? What were you trying to avoid?

Respondent: Prejudice around it that I had of myself. I had an early experience as a kid, prior to all this going down, of hearing how people talked about disabled people. I knew that was part of my denial that doctors told me I was going to be like that as well, and then not wanting to be perceived that way and being ridiculed and looked down upon. In turn, I had it myself, which was sort of ugly of me.

Moderator: I just so appreciate your honesty. Was there a specific event or a specific set of events that you remember in terms of the people?

Respondent: I have a weird family dynamic, but my adopted father, who wasn't my biological dad, married my mom. We were driving down the road. There was a gentleman in a motorized wheelchair coming down the sidewalk. I was in my early teenage years, and he was bumping on the sidewalk. My dad made an off-colored joke. That really struck me knowing that I have this disease. I don't even know if he was aware of it. It just came out. It wasn't an apology; it just was what it was. I don't blame him. He was raised in a certain way as well. It was common to make fun of people less fortunate because it's funny, but it's not funny.

Moderator: When you were diagnosed at eleven, ten, eleven, twelve, how was it described to you? Do you remember?

Respondent: Before I was told I had SMA, my primary care physician in Ohio knew somebody. He was asking around trying to find out what was going on with me. He couldn't figure it out, so he sent me to a doctor at a local university where we lived. That doctor described that he said this. Basically, he had no bedside manner whatsoever. He said, you're showing all the signs of muscular dystrophy. You're going to be confined to a wheelchair with no movement from the neck down before you graduate high school. I'm sorry to be blunt, but I just want you to accept or get ready for what's to come. This is now time to start planning and making the decisions your family needs to make. I had my adopted dad and my stepmom sitting there, both uneducated, and it was like, wait a minute. I just got done with baseball practice. It was hard. It was very hard. There was no bedside manner whatsoever. I think he was trying to be blunt and not give hope, but as a kid, that was hard.

Moderator: Sorry. Sometimes when things are just so hard, I have to just pause for a second. It's just so intense. You've described these lows that you're receiving, but then you're also describing yourself as this incredibly remarkable young person, going to this great university and being very ambitious. It's striking.

Respondent: I truly believe the reason why I was able to do what I've been able to do is because of my denial and stubbornness that I was not going to fall victim to what they're classifying and say I was going to be. If I would have listened to what they said and internalized that, I think I would have become worse off quicker, and I don't think I would have achieved anything that I've achieved.

Moderator: So for you, a lot of your health, you attribute to keeping SMA at bay in some ways, like keeping some separation between you and involving yourself in this disease.

Respondent: Yeah.

Moderator: It's also striking. So you start going to these Facebook groups. Do you remember what led you to go to these Facebook groups? Because I want to get to the point that it was knowing that there's treatment available that was clearly significant for you. But there's a step before that.

Respondent: I don't know if I joined them before or after, but one of the changes that occurred when we moved to Georgia, we went to an abilities expo type conference that had different things. The type of wheelchair that I was in, there was a gentleman that was in the same type of chair that was very interested because of the wheelchair I was in. He was trying to promote power wheelchair soccer. My wheelchair was the type that is very good for that sport. He wanted to buy my chair from me and get me to play power wheelchair soccer. Through that, I started getting on Facebook, and I'm thinking that's when either through connections with them that maybe that popped up that you might be interested in the support groups because he and some of the other players were in these groups.

Moderator: When did you start using a wheelchair? How old were you?

Respondent: I got one right after I went to a community college right out of high school, but then I went away to a major university right before I turned 21. I transferred, and that's when I got the motorized wheelchair because the college I went to was basically built on a hill. I wasn't using it full time. I would literally ride the wheelchair to class, park it outside the classroom, stand up out of the chair, grab my cane, and walk in. It never went in with me. I wanted to show everybody that I'm not the chair. I didn't start using a chair constantly until I had a leg break when I was 34 or 35. Then another one, and then another one, and it sort of led me. So I've been confined to the wheelchair for about eight or nine years now.

Moderator: How did you feel when you're on these Facebook groups? It sounds like you were initially kind of a lurker. Is that a fair word?

Respondent: A little bit, yeah. I still might be a lurker. Sometimes I'll post, but most of the time, I'm just looking, observing, reading.

Moderator: Me too. Most of us. And then there are those people who overpost and you're like, dude, don't you have any sense that you're sharing this face?

Respondent: Yeah.

Moderator: How did you feel reading about Spinraza? Tell me about when you first started hearing about treatment for SMA on those Facebook groups. That's very important to me to understand how that made you feel.

Respondent: It made me feel hopeful that, wait a minute. For so long, I heard that there's nothing. They didn't even know what was causing it. When they were able to identify what the cause was, it was like, well, it took them this long. There's never going to be anything. Then I hear that, wait a minute, we found something that stops the progression. It started to make me feel hopeful. If I can get comfortable with where I'm at today, if we could just stay like this, okay, I can function the rest of my life like this. I was still driving, still working, bathing on my own. It was a lot of hope. But with the administration of it with Spinraza, I just did not like it. I don't know why I was so against it. I think because I just want something that's non-intrusive, that's easy. I don't like spending a lot of time at doctors. I want to live my life. When I started hearing about, oh, there's something you could just take, it was like, oh, I take medicine at night for pain and to help me sleep, and I take vitamins. I'll swallow a pill all day long. When I started hearing about Everesti, that was okay. I can get on board with that.

Moderator: Okay. I had written down here that at some point in your history, you have taken both Everesti and Spinraza. Is that accurate?

Respondent: I was part of the clinical trial that I just was a part of for the past year and a half.

Moderator: Alright. Okay. So when did you take Everesti liquid from one to one? Do you happen to remember?

Respondent: So I've been on it on two separate occasions. The first time, I started in April 2021, and I took it until April 2022.

Moderator: Wow. Okay. Twelve months.

Respondent: Yep.

Moderator: And then I stayed off of all medicine from that time until, I think it was more like May 2023. Then I stopped it in December 2023 and started the clinical trial with Spinraza in December 2023.

Moderator: Was it any particular... I mean, given that Spinraza was already out, was it a certain kind of Spinraza with a clinical trial?

Respondent: It was the double dose of Spinraza.

Moderator: Okay. So when did you let me just get these dates down. So when did you take Everesti?

Respondent: I started in April 2021 and took it until April 2022. Then I stayed off of all medicine until May 2023. I stopped it in December 2023 and started the clinical trial with Spinraza.

Moderator: Was it a higher dosage?

Respondent: Yes.

Moderator: Okay. And how long were you on that clinical trial with the higher dose of Spinraza?

Respondent: Up until April, my last dose of that I participated in was April 2025.

Moderator: Wow. Okay. So, like, fifteen months.

Respondent: Yeah.

Moderator: And you're not on anything right now?

Respondent: No. I'm not on anything. I decided not to continue with the trial.

Moderator: Oh, there was a... did you opt out?

Respondent: I could have kept doing it. I'm a non-responder to that medication. It did not keep me stable. I continued to digress the entire time. There was no change. I actually got worse.

Moderator: Okay. Alright. So, again, 2017, 2018, you're aware. It's interesting initially that you were so averse to the lumbar puncture. Obviously, you then did that for a year. Any thoughts about back then, what was the major, like, for you and maybe why it was different later?

Respondent: I think the big part was I was just a workaholic. I didn't want to take the time off, the travel, to have to transfer to possibly have any adverse effects, which I did have a little bit of that once I did start taking it. I didn't realize what the adverse effects were. I just didn't like the fact of putting needles in my back.

Moderator: Okay. Now my tune changed when I saw that a lot of people were having more stability on Spinraza. I had a different experience with Everesti, and it was even more... my interest was piqued because, oh, here's double the dose of this stuff that other people are saying they're having more stability and actually maybe more gains on Spinraza than Everesti.

Respondent: Yeah.

Moderator: So your perception of the costs and the benefits shifted. Number one, you heard the benefits being brought more in your face. You were sort of seeing them with your peers. And you saw that maybe even you could get double that or something like that.

Respondent: Yeah.

Moderator: Okay. Alright. To be honest, I had reached back out to the neurologist to see if I could get back on Everesti after that year hiatus anyways because I wanted to see if I could get the same boost because I got one hell of a boost from it the first time I was on it. I wanted to see if I would get that boost again, but we were running up against insurance denying it. What's funny, or not funny, or coincidental, is the day that I looked into the clinical trial is the day that my advocate for Everesti called and said, hey, I know you didn't want to pursue this anymore because you got denied twice, but we kept pushing and you got accepted. The trial needed me to be on it in order to get accepted for the trial. I look at that as a coincidence that maybe this is something I need to do.

Moderator: What do you mean maybe this is something?

Respondent: Well, whatever your beliefs are. Right? Okay. God, is this a sign that you're giving me something that, okay, this I need to realize I'm going downhill and all the stars just aligned. Okay. I'm just going to go forward with it.

Moderator: So just to be clear, did you go back on Everesti in order to get in the trial?

Respondent: Yes.

Moderator: So in April or May 2023, I started taking Everesti again. I had to be on it for six months before I could start the Spinraza trial.

Respondent: Yeah. That's why I said I've had Everesti twice.

Moderator: Okay. Got it. Got it. Okay. And how did it go for you the second time you were on it?

Respondent: The second time, I didn't get the boost that I did the first time. The first time when I took it, I literally had stopped driving my accessible vehicle several months prior. I started taking it that first time, and within a month and a half, I was strong enough to start driving again. I was able to wash my hair again. It was like, oh my gosh. This is amazing. But then what happened is after six months, it's like the bottom fell out, and I got worse quickly. It was devastating, and I couldn't... it never rebounded.

Moderator: Wait. When was that?

Respondent: That was the first time I took Everesti in April 2021.

Moderator: So at the six-month point, the first time after you've taken Everesti for six months, you sort of bottomed out. You had peaked and bottomed out still while you were on Everesti.

Respondent: Yeah.

Moderator: Is there... okay.

Respondent: Right. Since there was no testing of my physical ability during that time, they just gave it to me. If they would have tested and saw the gains that I was having at two months, four months, even six months, and then tested to see that, oh, wow, he's really gotten weaker and dramatically weaker. When we tried to get it renewed, insurance called and said, well, he's gotten worse. This hasn't kept him stable. This didn't do anything. So I don't know if I would have stayed on it longer if it would have come back around. I have no idea.

Moderator: So just so I'm clear, you had Everesti from April 2021 to April 2022. You had six months of remarkable progress and then six months of it sort of bringing you back down to where you were before, kind of.

Respondent: I'm not even back down where I was before. Worse than where I started. That's what was so scary.

Moderator: So what prompted you to stop Everesti in April of '22?

Respondent: Because insurance wouldn't pay for it. They wouldn't allow me to renew it.

Moderator: Okay.

Respondent: There was part of me going, wait a minute. I got worse. The other part was like, well, insurance has denied it anyway. That's the writing on the wall. The stars aligned. You're telling me I need to stay off of it. I'll stay off of it.

Moderator: Interesting. I know you just said you think insurance denied it because they did an annual baseline test and didn't see any progress. Is that your understanding of why they denied you at that point?

Respondent: Yes. That's what they had in the letter they sent back to me and the neurologist.

Moderator: It's striking to me that a couple points in your journey that I understand so far, you talk about how sometimes things are kind of like signs. Right? Given that you sort of declined on Everesti and the insurance denied you, you sort of had that acceptance of, like, it was meant to be. Am I understanding that correctly?

Respondent: Yeah.

Moderator: Right?

Respondent: You get that.

Moderator: Please tell me if I'm misunderstanding because you also said something similar about another time that I can't even... I think it was when the insurance for Everesti called you back and said, actually, we accepted you for the clinical trial.

Respondent: Right.

Moderator: So you're like, okay. So maybe this was also meant to be.

Respondent: Right. Because it all happened on the same day. What's the coincidence? I mean, okay, I've...

Moderator: Okay.

Respondent: If you... it's almost like hitting me upside the head going, here, dummy. Laying it out for you.

Moderator: And the second time you were on Everesti for six months, tell me again what your experience was with Everesti at that point.

Respondent: It wasn't as dramatic with the sudden feeling of being super strong and having this increased stability, but I did feel over time that I got stronger. It wasn't as quick as what that first time was, but by the time I was getting ready to switch and get on to the clinical trial, a friend of mine said, you know what? You seem to be doing really good here lately. If this new medicine could just keep you where you're at, you probably would be good, wouldn't you? It was like, yeah. I hadn't thought about it, but, yeah, I'm in a good spot with what my functionality is. It got to a point where I could manage life within the parameters I was at that second time on Everesti. But hence, I thought, well, let's go for the gusto and do the clinical trial and get double the dose of some medicine. My expectations were shattered.

Moderator: Yeah. And so your experience with the double dose was you described yourself as a non-responder and that you got worse.

Respondent: Yeah. They did the loading doses in December. By January, I felt like I was worse than where I started even with the Everesti that I started six months prior.

Moderator: And so then you were on... just to be 100% clear on timing, you were on the high dose of Spinraza from December 2023 to April 2025.

Respondent: Yes.

Moderator: Wow. Okay. So, like, fifteen months. And when did you exit the clinical trial? Was that your decision, or was it just...

Respondent: It was my decision, and it was twofold. One was I was not responding to it. The other was the manner in which the testing was being done. Before I would get the dose, they would do PT testing. In the course of that, I knew I was getting worse. They would go through these things, and if I couldn't do it, the lady would say, well, the directions say if you could do it this other way, you still get the same score. I was like, but doing it the other way discounts the fact that I can't do it the way that I used to be able to do it, but yet the researcher is going to see you're giving me the same score. How is that showing anything? I just did not like that. What bothered me was I realized because this clinic does a lot of trials for kids. If I was a kid, I would want to get the better score, and I would do that in order to get the better score, but that's not giving a true representation of what's going on. I started to read more about these clinical trials that, as long as thirty percent of the participants are showing either staying the same or sudden improvement, that's all the FDA needs. Here, these people are dying for a solution, and they're trusting all this, not realizing that they're possibly going to be a non-responder just like the rest. They're putting all their faith and hope, and no one's explaining to them what these trials really are. That's when I was like, I don't want to participate.

Moderator: Okay.

Respondent: I know.

Moderator: That was a lot. Sorry.

Respondent: No. That was really helpful to understand your general orientation towards all that because that is part of who you are in your journey. Okay. So I'm writing down all the things, if we have time, that I want to ask you. But how are you feeling? So tell me about you got off the clinical trial. What has your thinking been about you and treatment now moving forward? What has your thinking been for the last few months? What are you thinking about the next few months, next year?

Respondent: I think for right now, I just don't want to put my foot back into the arena. But I'm not going to close the door on it completely. I don't know which way I want to go. I feel as if the only two options I have are Everesti or Spinraza. I know there's some other things on the horizon, but they've not been approved yet. I don't know if I want to be... I don't know what the truth is because I haven't really looked into it of how long you have to be off of a trial before you're eligible to join another trial. I heard something that you need to be free and clear for a year. If the medicine that you're in a trial of had to be FDA approved, then you're free and clear to try whenever. If it hasn't been FDA approved, you have to wait a year before you can get engaged in another one. Part of me really doesn't want to be in the arena, but also I have a feeling I wouldn't be eligible anyway. There's always in the back of my mind, do I just want to try Everesti again? Because now it's in pill form. Let's just take a pill.

Moderator: So I was curious about this. You brought up my next exact question. So talk to me about your thoughts about you and Everesti. You and Everesti and your future.

Respondent: I wish I would know what would have happened this last time when I was on Everesti if I would have stayed on it more than six months. Would I have had the same experience I had the first time I was on it? Because that's what's odd. Here I was on something for six months, I felt good, but then I changed something. Was it that I changed something? Or was it that after six months, my body just starts rejecting it or it stops responding? I don't know. There's part of me that says, well, let's give it another try. If third time's a charm, if it happens the same way again, then that's a definite. This is how my body reacts to this medicine. The other is I never stayed on it longer. Does it ever rebound after being on it longer than a year? I've heard some people say the research shows after a two-year period that there's more stability. Does it ebb and flow and come back? I don't know. The third being a tablet, right, is now, since I'm weaker, would be an easier way for me to take it because I don't think I can draw it up and take it in the syringe like I was prior because of the more weakness that has occurred over the years.

Moderator: What do you think has stopped you at this point from going back on Everesti?

Respondent: Probably my own laziness to go make an appointment with a neurologist and have to get somebody to take me down to fight the Atlanta traffic. I'm not a very good passenger because I drove all my life, and being on the highway with eight lanes of cars freaks me out. Then having to go through the whole process of will it get denied and just... I mean, if it was as simple as calling the neurologist, prescribing it, getting it shipped to me, I'd probably just take it. It's the process.

Moderator: Why this... I want to figure... I wish I could ask this in a less loaded way. I'm interested in the fact that you don't see a neurologist regularly. That is striking to me. Can you tell me more about that?

Respondent: Because what does the neurologist do for me when I see the neurologist?

Moderator: I don't know what you would answer that.

Respondent: They don't do anything for me. I don't get any benefit from seeing a neurologist. I am able to update them on where I'm at, and unless I need something from them that is outside of the scope of what a primary physician who is closer to me can provide, there's nothing I get from that. Unfortunately, I'm going to get... not to give.

Moderator: Yeah.

Respondent: Right? I mean, I'm there for my own medical reasons. When I went to see her in the beginning, I needed her ability to write a prescription that my primary physician could have written but wouldn't have been able to back up in the manner to fight the insurance to get it approved.

Moderator: What does that sound like? I'm just...

Respondent: It sounds sick. Right? I'm just...

Moderator: No. It actually sounds like you're in charge.

Respondent: Okay.

Moderator: Right? Like, you were like, you know, I am in charge of my health care. What does it entail for you to go to the neurologist? Can you compare going to the neurologist, the logistical challenges of that versus going to your primary care physician? What does that look like?

Respondent: Yeah. The neurologist is probably a forty-five-minute drive down a super busy, highly trafficked, scary drive down I-85. It involves a hospital setting, and then a very quick... you feel like you're a bother because there are so many people in the waiting room to see somebody, and they're in and out, and it's quick. It's just not very personable. Going to my primary care physician, it's a ten-minute drive back roads to a place where we joke around. There's familiarity. It's like I'm seeing my friend, and we chat it up. She laughs at the way I talk about being disabled, and it's all good.

Moderator: Yeah.

Respondent: There's the difference. In my neurologist, she's a nice lady, but most of the time I'm not seeing her. I'm seeing a nurse practitioner. The nurse practitioner that I was seeing on a regular basis is no longer there. I would have to get reestablished with somebody new because I doubt I would see the actual neurologist. Again, what am I getting from that appointment?

Moderator: What do you wish... if you could create the perfect neurologist relationship, what would you wish you could get from a neurologist? In an ideal world, what could they do for you?

Respondent: Shane, here's the latest and greatest for Michael. Should I go by my middle name? Never mind. So I go by... I'm looking into this knowing your particular situation. Here's the latest and greatest. I know somebody that can get you into this trial or I know what we should do. I want to get you on this. In turn with that, we're going to get you set up to do these certain activities to help benefit not only the medicine but your physical abilities. Not here, you tell me. I had to go to her. I've heard this. How can I get that?

Moderator: Yeah.

Respondent: None of it was, well, if you're on that, you should also be doing these things as well. I was reading through Facebook groups of people that were, well, here, I take this type of protein and I'm doing this. I don't get anything like that. I would rather have a doctor tell me medically this is what we think will help versus try it and tell me if it works.

Moderator: How do you feel when you're sitting in the waiting room in this hospital setting? I'm just sort of curious. How do you feel?

Respondent: I feel as if I'm checking a box. I feel as if I'm checking a box going, okay. I've checked in with my neurologist. I can say they have on record I've had an appointment in x amount of time.

Moderator: Okay. It's just noteworthy to me that you said it's a hospital setting. What does it feel like that it's a hospital setting?

Respondent: I mean, I just... there's a lot of other... I don't know. It just feels... what's the feeling that you get in the hospital? Almost like, you know how I avoided the whole time with trying to not be sick? I'm in a hospital setting where I'm sick. I'm sick. Even with the primary care physician, I'm going into a facility, and there's other things going on there. But for whatever reason, it's... I don't know. It's almost like in my mind there's a difference. That is more of an acute illness to where neurologist is a chronic illness. This is bad, where the other one is, oh, this is temporary. I don't know why my mind has that, but that's in my mind.

Moderator: That makes total sense to me. Total, total sense. You talked about some awareness of there being some treatments in the pipeline. Any do you know anything about what's out there?

Respondent: I don't know them off the top of my head. I know there's one that's more associated with muscle therapy to actually strengthen the actual muscles. I forget what it's called, and that one's real close. I think it was going to be approved, but then they saw some issues with manufacturing, just like the double dose of Spinraza.

Moderator: Yeah. Yeah.

Respondent: I know there's a couple of other things, but I haven't really followed them because I know they're still in the clinical trial phase. I get the SMA news type of updates. I see that. When they send out the magazine or letter or whatever, I sort of see what medicines and where they're at in the pipeline. I don't really pay any attention to them until they start getting a little bit further on.

Moderator: Yep. Okay. I think that muscle one, I in my mind call an anti-myostatin.

Respondent: Yeah.

Moderator: I don't know if that's familiar.

Respondent: That's not.

Moderator: Yeah.

Respondent: No. Yeah.

Moderator: What are your thoughts about that one?

Respondent: I don't know. That one, I sort of... the way that I initially read it, it sort of seemed like it was to do in combination with the therapy. So then that's where it's like, okay. I would still have to pick Spinraza or Everesti and then this on top of it. My concern is what's insurance going to pay? I mean, the other ones are pretty expensive, and then you're adding that one as well. This is going to sound sort of bad, but is my life really worth that price tag? I don't know.

Moderator: How do you answer that question?

Respondent: Well, it's hard. You see insurance companies having these profits out the yin yang, but then, I mean, what? A million dollars or more just to possibly try something that may or may not benefit? I don't know. What could we use that money for other things? There are people in much worse scenarios than I'm in. I mean, people that don't... I live a lavish life.

Moderator: If you think about the future and the possibility of these treatments for you, what or whom do you think will have the most influence on whether or not you actually go down the treatment route? It's going to require work for you because it's not already set up. You have a doctor who thinks you have muscular dystrophy who's in the groove. But if you're going to get SMA-specific treatment, you're going to have to find a doc. You don't even have a nurse practitioner. You're going to have to set it all up. You're going to have to go to a place that feels really uncomfortable. You might have to fight the insurance. What do you think would be the biggest help for you in accessing treatment? Say you decide on some level you would like to get treatment, but you wish it could be emotionally and logistically easier. What would make it easier for you in both of those ways?

Respondent: I don't see any change in how I have to go about it. What would be the perfect scenario? I don't know. Have an educated primary physician that could just take the place of the neurologist. That would probably be the easiest route.

Moderator: I wonder about an advocate. It's interesting you described how the Everesti advocate called you and said...

Respondent: She still keeps in touch with us, which is cool. She reached out to me just a month ago.

Moderator: How did that go? What's that like for you when you get those reach-outs?

Respondent: I sort of felt a connection with her. We went to one of the little luncheon things and got to meet her. We would have conversations, and it was really helpful through the whole process of getting on Everesti. I don't think I would have gone down the rabbit hole if it wasn't for that. It was just nice that I wasn't just, oh, I got him on it and let's move on. She just continues to check in.

Moderator: Do you ever talk to her about the possibility of restarting the treatment?

Respondent: Yeah. I mentioned to her that I had stopped doing the clinical trial and that I was hesitant about Everesti just based on the past scenarios that I've gone through. That's when she said, well, there's also another drug that's on the horizon of getting approved. You might want to look into it. I said, yeah, I've heard of it. That was it.

Moderator: It's so nice that you feel like she's in your corner.

Respondent: Yeah.

Moderator: I could not have asked for a better first respondent. I feel so lucky that I got to talk to you. You are so self-aware. It's striking. It's really, really helpful. I really enjoyed talking to you.

Respondent: Yeah.

Moderator: Thank you so much for sharing everything. I have no idea. I am actually married to a Gator, a Florida Gator.

Respondent: You gotta tell them that us Buckeyes aren't that bad. We're not that bad.

Moderator: I feel like I'm always listening to Michigan, Buckeyes, Gators. Even my 14-year-old son, when he uses the pronoun, he says, well, we. I was like, Harry, who's the we? He's like, the Gators, mom. I was like, oh, brainwash.

Respondent: That's funny.

Moderator: Listen. I wish you all the best. You've been so great, and thanks so much for your time.

Respondent: Alright. You too.

Moderator: Okay. Bye.

Respondent: Bye.
