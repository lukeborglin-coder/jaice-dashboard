What prompted you to stop working?\nRespondent: My upper body is now being affected, so I was struggling to type. I tried doing, you know, text to speech, and I just could not reinvent the wheel.

I kept on falling down when running. Not all the time. So they and it was just my right leg that would give out. So then that started doctor's appointments.
