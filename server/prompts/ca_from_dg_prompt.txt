You will analyze a Discussion Guide (DG) and create a Content Analysis template for qualitative research data collection.

TASK: Generate a JSON structure representing Excel sheets where each row will capture a respondent's interview responses.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1) READ the Discussion Guide and identify the EXACT section headings/titles
2) CREATE sheet names using the EXACT section names from the discussion guide (preserve original capitalization, spacing, and punctuation)
3) For each sheet, create column headers that capture the questions/topics being discussed
4) Include standard respondent tracking columns: "Respondent ID", "Interview Date", "Interview Time"
5) Add columns for each question/topic in that section
6) Return empty template structure (no sample data - this will be filled by researchers)

SHEET CREATION RULES:
- Always include a "Demographics" sheet for respondent tracking (simplified - only Respondent ID)
- Create separate sheets for each major section found in the discussion guide
- Use the EXACT section headings from the discussion guide as sheet names
- Do NOT modify, abbreviate, or standardize section names - use them exactly as written
- If there are subsections, create separate sheets for each major subsection

COLUMN GENERATION RULES:
- Start each sheet with ONLY: "Respondent ID"
- Create HIGH-LEVEL CATEGORY/HEADLINE columns for bucketing key findings (NOT individual questions)
- Columns should be broad themes/topics that capture the essence of multiple related questions
- Think of columns as "buckets" where qualitative insights will be organized
- Use concise, descriptive category names (e.g., "Awareness & Usage", "Barriers", "Preferences", "Key Benefits")
- Do NOT create a column for each individual question - instead group related questions under thematic categories
- Do NOT include "Interview Date", "Interview Time" in any section except Demographics

DEMOGRAPHICS SHEET RULES:
- Demographics sheet should ONLY include: "Respondent ID", "Interview Date", "Interview Time"
- Do NOT include other demographic fields like "Specialty", "Years Experience", "Practice Setting", "Patient Volume"
- This allows researchers to manually add their own demographic columns as needed

TEMPLATE STRUCTURE:
- Each sheet should have empty rows (template for data entry)
- Include 3-5 empty respondent rows as examples
- Column headers should be clear and match the discussion flow

OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
  "Demographics": [
    {"Respondent ID": "", "Interview Date": "", "Interview Time": ""}
  ],
  "[EXACT SECTION NAME FROM DG]": [
    {"Respondent ID": "", "Awareness & Usage": "", "Key Drivers": "", "Barriers & Challenges": ""}
  ],
  "[ANOTHER EXACT SECTION NAME]": [
    {"Respondent ID": "", "Current Approach": "", "Unmet Needs": "", "Future Preferences": ""}
  ]
}
