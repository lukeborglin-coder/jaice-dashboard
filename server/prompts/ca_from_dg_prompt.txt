You will analyze a Discussion Guide (DG) and create a Content Analysis template for qualitative research data collection.

TASK: Generate a JSON structure representing Excel sheets where each row will capture a respondent's interview responses.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1) READ the Discussion Guide and identify the EXACT section headings/titles
2) CREATE sheet names using the EXACT section names from the discussion guide (preserve original capitalization, spacing, and punctuation)
3) For each sheet, create column headers that capture the questions/topics being discussed
4) Include standard respondent tracking columns: "Respondent ID", "Specialty", "Date", "Time (ET)"
5) Add columns for each question/topic in that section
6) Return empty template structure (no sample data - this will be filled by researchers)

SHEET CREATION RULES:
- Always include a "Demographics" sheet for respondent tracking (simplified - only Respondent ID)
- Create separate sheets for each major section found in the discussion guide
- Use the EXACT section headings from the discussion guide as sheet names
- Do NOT modify, abbreviate, or standardize section names - use them exactly as written
- If there are subsections, create separate sheets for each major subsection

COLUMN GENERATION RULES:
- Start each sheet with ONLY: "Respondent ID"
- Add columns for each question/topic in that discussion section
- Use descriptive headers that match the discussion guide questions
- Include rating scale columns if the DG has rating exercises
- Add open-ended response columns for qualitative feedback
- Do NOT include "Specialty", "Date", "Time (ET)" in any section except Demographics

DEMOGRAPHICS SHEET RULES:
- Demographics sheet should ONLY include: "Respondent ID", "Specialty", "Date", "Time (ET)"
- Do NOT include other demographic fields like "Years Experience", "Practice Setting", "Patient Volume"
- This allows researchers to manually add their own demographic columns as needed

TEMPLATE STRUCTURE:
- Each sheet should have empty rows (template for data entry)
- Include 3-5 empty respondent rows as examples
- Column headers should be clear and match the discussion flow

OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
  "Demographics": [
    {"Respondent ID": "", "Specialty": "", "Date": "", "Time (ET)": ""}
  ],
  "[EXACT SECTION NAME FROM DG]": [
    {"Respondent ID": "", "Question 1": "", "Question 2": "", "Rating": ""}
  ],
  "[ANOTHER EXACT SECTION NAME]": [
    {"Respondent ID": "", "Topic A": "", "Topic B": "", "Response": ""}
  ]
}
