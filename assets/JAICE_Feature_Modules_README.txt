JAICE Project Management Dashboard ‚Äì Feature Module Plan
========================================================

These are **new features and adjustments** I want to make to my current site. Each **Module** below represents a bundle of related enhancements. Tackle them one at a time.

üëâ After completing a module, mark it as ‚úÖ DONE at the top of the section.

==================================================================
üéØ OVERVIEW: HOME DASHBOARD vs PROJECT HUB ‚Äì CLEAR DIFFERENTIATION
==================================================================

The JAICE platform consists of **two core dashboard views**:

1. üè† **HOME DASHBOARD** (High-Level Overview)
   - Primary landing screen after login.
   - Designed for **individual users** to get an immediate sense of what's urgent, what they're working on, and where their projects stand.
   - **Vertical scroll layout** showing a **list of active projects**, ordered by recency and priority.
   - This is NOT for editing‚Äîjust a clean summary view. Users click into a project to go deeper.

   Core elements:
   - "Your Week at a Glance": shows only tasks assigned to the logged-in user this week.
   - Project cards: vertical scroll list, minimal info shown (project title, phase, due dates).
   - Priority badges: Reporting phase = highest, shifts dynamically based on timeline/help request.
   - Clicking a project = navigate to that project‚Äôs **Project Hub dashboard**.

2. üß† **PROJECT HUB DASHBOARD** (Full Interactive Project Workspace)
   - This is the **detailed view per project**.
   - Users manage the timeline, phases, task list, documents, vendors, and objectives here.
   - Fully interactive. Editable. Designed for collaboration.
   - This is where admin or power users work.

   Core elements:
   - Top banner: Project name, methodology, background, objectives.
   - Linked SharePoint files + kickoff decks.
   - Vendor/moderator assignment and visibility.
   - Comments and feature request submission.

- At top: "Your Week at a Glance" section with:
  - Tasks assigned to current user due this week
