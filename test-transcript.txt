Moderator: Thank you for joining us today. Let's start with your current practice setting.

Respondent: I work at an academic hospital with both inpatient and outpatient responsibilities. I see about 25-30 SMA patients across all age groups.

Moderator: What treatment approaches do you currently use?

Respondent: I prefer gene therapy options, particularly oral treatments like Evrysdi. I have about 15+ patients currently on Evrysdi, using both tablet and liquid formulations.

Moderator: What challenges do you face with treatment?

Respondent: The main issues are insurance coverage problems and route of administration concerns with Spinraza. Patients often struggle with the lumbar puncture procedure.

Moderator: How do you rank different categories of information?

Respondent: I value concrete data over broad statements. I prefer mechanistic understanding first, so I'd rank mechanism of action as #1, then category C for specificity as #2. All these categories target the SMN protein, primarily associated with Spinraza and Evrysdi.
